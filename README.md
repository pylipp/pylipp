#### Hej there

I'm Philipp, based in the Munich area, Germany.

Currently I work as a software engineer for the NGO [boxtribute](https://www.boxtribute.org) that provides a web application to organize efficient, fair and dignified distribution of goods in the field of migration. You can fund our efforts and help us extend our non-commercial product to serve even more people in need!

I enjoy developing with Python, using efficient tooling in the command line and the terminal, if possible. Technologies I've been working with include
- web development (GraphQL, flask, REST)
- desktop GUI development (PyQt5, QML)
- database management (MySQL, peewee)
- GPU programming (pyopencl)
- scientific programming, data analysis, and image processing (numpy, scipy, pandas, OpenCV)

Besides some hobby software projects (explore below) I try to make purposeful impact in ecological and social projects, e.g. community-supported agriculture, awareness for resource sustainability (especially food waste), permaculture.
